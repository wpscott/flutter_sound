## Features

- Play and Record sounds or music with various codecs. (See [the supported codecs here](doc/codec.md#actually-the-following-codecs-are-supported-by-flutter_sound))
- Play local or remote files specified by their URL.
- The App playback can be controled from the device lock screen or from an Apple watch
- Handle playback stream from native (To sync exact time with bridging). [*Not sure to understand what it means!*]

## Flutter Sound branches

We actually maintain two branches for Flutter Sound :

- The V4 branch (the version ^4.0.0)
- The master branch (actually the version ^5.0.0)

We do not expect that everybody will switch today from 4.x.x to 5.x.x.

V4 is our stable branch, and will be maintained as long as everybody will not have switch to V5 :
in other words V4 is our LTS version (Long Term Support).

## Migration Guides

- To migrate [to 4.x.x from 3.x.x](doc/migration_4.x.x.md#migration-from-3xx-to-4xx) you must do some minor changes in your configurations files.
- To migrate [to 5.x.x from 4.x.x](doc/migration_5.x.x.md#migration-form-4xx-to-5xx) you must do a few changes in your App.

## SDK requirements

- Flutter Sound requires an iOS 9.3 SDK (or later)

## Installation

[Here is a guide](doc/install.md#install) for Flutter Sound installation

## Flutter Sound API

Flutter Sound is composed with 4 modules :

- [FlutterSoundPlayer](doc/player.md#flutter-sound-player-api), wich deal with everything about playbacks
- [FlutterSoundRecorder](doc/recorder.md#flutter-sound-recorder-api), which deal with everything about recording
- [FlutterSoundHelper](doc/helper.md), which offers some convenients tools
- [FlutterSoundUI](doc/ui_widget.md), which offer some Widget ready to be used out of the box

To use Flutter Sound you just do :
```
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
```

This will export all the necessaries dart interfaces.

## Examples (Demo Apps)

Flutter Sound comes with two Demo/Examples :
- [Demo1 app](example/README.md#demo1) is a small demonstration of what we can do with Flutter Sound.
This Demo App is a kind of exerciser which try to implement the major Flutter Sound features. This Demo does not use the Flutter Sound UI Widgets
- [Demo2 app](example/README.md#demo2) is an example of what can be done using the Flutter Sound UI Widgets
